Explanation: All code is implemented in the provided skeleton file, pa1.py.
A number of helper methods were implemented to handle data from the bayes_net object.

q6: The log-sum-exp trick is implemented in the function calc_mll_lse  

NOTE: All math required for these problems is either inline or implemented in code.
I did not have time to do a writeup of these portions in the assignment submitted
on gradescope, so I hope the work in the python file is taken into account.
