Problem 9. Programming assignment

1. How many values can the random vector X... take, i.e. how many different 28x28 binary images are there?

There are 2^(28x28) = 2^784 binary images.

2. How many parameters would you need to specify an arbitrary probability distribution over all possible 28x28 binary images?

You would need 2^(28x28) - 1 = 2^784 - 1 parameters to specify an arbitrary probability distribution over all possible 28x28 images.

3. How many parameters do you need to specify the Bayesian network in Figure 1?

The joint probability distribution for the Bayesian network in Figure 1 can be written as:
P(Z1)*P(Z2)*P(X1|Z1,Z2)*P(X2|Z1,Z2)*...*P(X784|Z1,Z2)

The conditional terms have 3 parameters each, and there are 784 of them. So the total
number of parameters needed is 784*3+2 = 2354 

4. None

5. What is the intuitive role of the Z1,Z2 variables in this model?
