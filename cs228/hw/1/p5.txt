a.
b.
c. d-sep({A,B};{G,H}|F)
Is there any active path between {A,G}, {A,H}, {B,G}, {B,H} given F
There are 3 ways to get to G from A or B, all include F:
C->F->G: blocked
D->F->G: blocked
H->F->G: blocked

There is an active path from B->H|F
B->E->H: cascade (not blocked)

Since there is an active path from B->H, this is not d-sep
