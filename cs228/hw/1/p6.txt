1. What's the expected Creativity score of a student?

Since the Creativity score is uniformly distributed in [0,1], the expected score is 0.5

2. What's the expected Creativity score of an admitted student?

The average C+I of an admitted student is 1.75

Since C and I are independent, and both uniformly distributed in [0,1], the average Creativity of an admitted student should be half this value at 0.875

To calculate E(C|A=1), we first need to find P(C|A=1), which is obtained by marginalization of P(C,I|A=1)
P(C,I|A=1) = P(C|I,A=1)*P(I|A=1) = 

3. What's the expected Creativity score of a student with I=0.95 (a highly intelligent student)?

4. 

a. What's the expected Creativity score of an admitted student with I=0.95?

b. How does it compare to the expected Creativity score of an admitted student (computed in 2)?
