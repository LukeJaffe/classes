MATCH_KEYPOINTS: Given two sets of descriptors corresponding to SIFT keypoints, 
find pairs of matching keypoints.

Note: Read Lowe's Keypoint matching, finding the closest keypoint is not
sufficient to find a match. thresh is the theshold for a valid match.

Arguments:
    descriptors1 - Descriptors corresponding to the first image. Each row
        corresponds to a descriptor. This is a ndarray of size (M_1, 128).

    descriptors2 - Descriptors corresponding to the second image. Each row
        corresponds to a descriptor. This is a ndarray of size (M_2, 128).

    threshold - The threshold which to accept from Lowe's Keypoint Matching
        algorithm

Returns:
    matches - An int ndarray of size (N, 2) of indices that for keypoints in 
        descriptors1 match which keypoints in descriptors2. For example, [7 5]
        would mean that the keypoint at index 7 of descriptors1 matches the
        keypoint at index 5 of descriptors2. Not every keypoint will necessarily
        have a match, so N is not the same as the number of rows in descriptors1
        or descriptors2.

'''
REFINE_MATCH: Filter out spurious matches between two images by using RANSAC
to find a projection matrix. 

Arguments:
    keypoints1 - Keypoints in the first image. Each row is a SIFT keypoint
        consisting of (u, v, scale, theta). Overall, this variable is a ndarray
        of size (M_1, 4).

    keypoints2 - Keypoints in the second image. Each row is a SIFT keypoint
        consisting of (u, v, scale, theta). Overall, this variable is a ndarray
        of size (M_2, 4).

    matches - An int ndarray of size (N, 2) of indices that indicate what
        keypoints from the first image (keypoints1)  match with the second 
        image (keypoints2). For example, [7 5] would mean that the keypoint at
        index 7 of keypoints1 matches the keypoint at index 5 of keypoints2). 
        Not every keypoint will necessarily have a  match, so N is not the same
        as the number of rows in keypoints1 or keypoints2. 

    reprojection_threshold - If the reprojection error is below this threshold,
        then we will count it as an inlier during the RANSAC process.

    num_iterations - The number of iterations we will run RANSAC for.

Returns:
    inliers - A vector of integer indices that correspond to the inliers of the
        final model found by RANSAC.

    model - The projection matrix H found by RANSAC that has the most number of
        inliers.

'''
GET_OBJECT_REGION: Get the parameters for each of the predicted object
bounding box in the image

Arguments:
    keypoints1 - Keypoints in the first image. Each row is a SIFT keypoint
        consisting of (u, v, scale, theta). Overall, this variable is a ndarray
        of size (M_1, 4).

    keypoints2 - Keypoints in the second image. Each row is a SIFT keypoint
        consisting of (u, v, scale, theta). Overall, this variable is a ndarray
        of size (M_2, 4).

    matches - An int ndarray of size (N, 2) of indices that indicate what
        keypoints from the first image (keypoints1)  match with the second 
        image (keypoints2). For example, [7 5] would mean that the keypoint at
        index 7 of keypoints1 matches the keypoint at index 5 of keypoints2). 
        Not every keypoint will necessarily have a  match, so N is not the same
        as the number of rows in keypoints1 or keypoints2.

    obj_bbox - An ndarray of size (4,) that contains [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
        of the bounding box. Note that the point (xmin, ymin) is one corner of
        the box and (xmax, ymax) is the opposite corner of the box.

    thresh - The threshold we use in Hough voting to state that we have found
        a valid object region.

Returns:
    cx - A list of the x location of the center of the bounding boxes

    cy - A list of the y location of the center of the bounding boxes

    w - A list of the width of the bounding boxes

    h - A list of the height of the bounding boxes

    orient - A list f the orientation of the bounding box. Note that the 
        theta provided by the SIFT keypoint is inverted. You will need to
        re-invert it.

MATCH_OBJECT: The pipeline for matching an object in one image with another

Arguments:
    im1 - The first image read in as a ndarray of size (H, W, C).

    descriptors1 - Descriptors corresponding to the first image. Each row
        corresponds to a descriptor. This is a ndarray of size (M_1, 128).

    keypoints1 - Keypoints in the first image. Each row is a SIFT keypoint
        consisting of (u, v, scale, theta). Overall, this variable is a ndarray
        of size (M_1, 4).

    im2 - The second image read in as a ndarray of size (H, W, C).

    descriptors2 - Descriptors corresponding to the second image. Each row
        corresponds to a descriptor. This is a ndarray of size (M_2, 128).

    keypoints2 - Keypoints in the second image. Each row is a SIFT keypoint
        consisting of (u, v, scale, theta). Overall, this variable is a ndarray

    obj_bbox - An ndarray of size (4,) that contains [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
        of the bounding box. Note that the point (xmin, ymin) is one corner of
        the box and (xmax, ymax) is the opposite corner of the box.

Returns:
    descriptors - The descriptors corresponding to the keypoints inside the
        bounding box.

    keypoints - The pixel locations of the keypoints that reside in the 
        bounding box
